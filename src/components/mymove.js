                Our midterm project for Road to Hire was to emulate a Sketch file to the best of our abilities. Due to the 
                requirement of fidelity to the file, this project is best viewed in 1440x990 screen resolution. The Sketch 
                file is hosted on the website link, and the main article header links to the second page of the Sketch file.
